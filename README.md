# BMI Calculator App

### Vanilla Javascript Project

#### Project description

##### Let's embark on creating a weight converter project specifically designed to convert pounds to kilograms. The webpage will consist of an input field where users can input a weight in pounds, and the page will dynamically display the equivalent weight in kilograms. To enhance the user experience, we will implement a feature that automatically removes the result after 10 seconds, clearing the input field using the 'setTimeOut' method.
##### Additionally, we have integrated an error handling mechanism to address negative input numbers. If the user enters a negative number, the webpage will promptly exhibit an error message stating, "Please enter a valid number." To ensure a smooth user experience, the error message will vanish after two seconds using an event listener linked to the input field. This event listener will trigger a function responsible for executing the desired actions.
##### Through this project, we will gain valuable insights into handling error situations, implementing event listeners, and utilizing functions to achieve the intended functionalities.
